Team

In order to make a dynamic web page to list only the open defects , I needed
to pass an Array List to the jsp.  For this to happen, I needed to import the Defect class
into the jsp.  This required that it be in a package.  I named the package teamc.  You will
need to create a package within Eclipse and place the servlets and java files in it.  The web.xml is setup for this.

My files that I downloaded are
OpenDefectPage.jsp
OpenDefects.java
DetailTester.java (used to verify that clicking on link in form sent the parameter onward).
web.xml

In order to run this you need to call on the servlet like  we did on the first servlet homework.
I will create an index.html that passes everything to the servlet next.

Also, all of the formatting was lost on the OpenDefects.jsp.  I will try and fiqure this out.
