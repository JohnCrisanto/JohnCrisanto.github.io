I set up the Index.html and the Open Defects Page to use a logo (png file).
In order for this to work you need to place the logo file(Evil_Corp.png) in a
directory /WebContent/images/Evil_Corp.png and also in the same directory as the 
index.html file.   

I am just playing around with the name and logo, but it is all setup to use with any logo
we choose.  

I also needed to update the style sheet.
