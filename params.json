  "body": "### Project Overview\r\nIn our Java II course, we were instructed to design and build a web application that serves to track application defects.  The idea is that our system will be used to track defects against existing applications.  It is a simple system used by staff to track bug ticket requests from submission to closure.  \r\n\r\n### Application Basic Features\r\n* The system allows the user to view all open tickets for all existing applications registered within the system database.\r\n* The system gives the user the ability to filter which application they want to view existing tickets for.\r\n* The system allows the user to view the details of an open ticket. \r\n* The system allows for the submission of a new ticket.\r\n* The system is configured to notify the assignee of the ticket through email upon updating or creating a ticket.\r\n* The application utilizes a relational database as a mean for data storage, which allows information to persist between user sessions.\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\n\r\nThe following folder structure can be implemented under your web-server:\r\n* classes: .class files compiled from .java files\r\n* jsp: the .jsp files are placed here\r\n* ROOT: the .html and .css files go here\r\n* WEB-INF: web.xml needs to be placed here\r\n* images: place .jpg files here\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFirst, I would like to thank my instructor, Kesha Smith (@ProfessorKesha) for giving us an opportunity to work on a great project such as this one.  I would also like to thank my group members Felipe Oliveira De Souza (@felipeJava1), Lawrence Van Sant (@LarryVS), and Samuel Ratemo (@sratemo)for all their efforts when we put this project together.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nJohn Crisanto(@JohnCrisanto) and my email is jcrisanto87@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n### Download Link\r\nPlease visit and download the application source code from the \"src\" directory at the following link:\r\n[Java II, Team C - Bug Tracker System](https://github.com/JohnCrisanto/JohnCrisanto.github.io)\r\n",
